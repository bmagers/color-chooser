## color-chooser

A color chooser app written as a design assessment exercise for New Engen.

## To do

A few quirks remain to be fixed:

In list view, color links don't behave as expected if list is randomized.

In detail view, clear button is essentially a back button.  If user has clicked around in the thumbnail images, they will need to click the clear button more than once to go back to list view.  Should only need to click once.

Responsive sizing of images could be better.

Search bar not yet implemented.
